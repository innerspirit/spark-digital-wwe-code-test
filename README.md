# spark-digital-wwe-code-test
My solution to the Spark Digital WWE front-end code test.

Uses Vue, vue-cli and SASS. Images were optimized with TinyPNG.
There is no custom JavaScript, vue-cli was only used to set up the environment.

## Installation
This code was bootstrapped using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/dev/docs/README.md#introduction). If any issues arise, install vue-cli as well.

### To install this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Execute `npm install` in the command line
3. Execute `npm run serve`
4. open `http://localhost:8080/`
